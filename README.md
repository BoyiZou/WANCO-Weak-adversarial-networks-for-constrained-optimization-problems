# WANCO: Weak adversarial networks for constrained optimization problems

## A brief introduction to WANCO
Weak adversarial networks for constrained optimization problems (WANCO) is a deep learning based framework for constrained optimization problems related to differential operators. It integrates the augmented Lagrangian method and adversarial network
